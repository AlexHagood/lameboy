# Lame Gameboy Emulator
Trying to implement a game boy emulator. Deliberately not trying to look at any guides that deal with this topic specifically (Rylev's GB emulator tutorial),
but implement everything myself based on my understanding of the archtecture.
Going to start with no MBC, just ROM like Tetris and Dr. Mario.
